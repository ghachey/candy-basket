<h1>Developer Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#developer-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea is to develop a very user friendly tool to help people dump
thoughts in a flexible database for later use. It works in a similar
fashion as Delicious. The tool is called Candy Basket hereafter
referred to as CB. This service was built using a number of modern
technologies which are described herein.</p>
<div class="section" id="programming-language">
<h3>Programming Language<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-language" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The chosen programming language is Javascript both on the backend and
the frontend. Javascript is relatively easy to get started with, it is
increasingly popular to develop web applications and has a growing
wealth of libraries to use to build systems faster. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> is the Javascript backend platform and a
decent starting point and reference for the Javascript language is
provided by the <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="web-stack">
<h3>Web Stack<a class="headerlink" href="#web-stack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>No web application is built without a web framework (or library). The
prototype was built using Bottle/Flask in Python but the production
system will move to NodeJS and <a class="reference external" href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>. Both are good choices but moving to the
NodeJS has a number of advanges which were important to us including
pervasive use of asynchronous programming on backend and frontend
making it easier to scale with same amount of resources. A road to
unify backend and frontend languages, libraries and devleopment
tooling.</p>
<p>A micro framework was prefered to a full blown and much less flexible
framework such as Django or Ruby on Rails. Applications can be fine
crafted much better with small composable libraries. In addition to
Express, a number of Express plugins are used when needed and
Express middleware pluggins can easily be written when none
appropriate are available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="database">
<h3>Database<a class="headerlink" href="#database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The CouchDB document database was chosen for its flexibility and
simplicity. CouchDB is one of the several NoSQL database types built
specifically for the web. If you are not familiar with CouchDB have a
look at its website at <a class="reference external" href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">https://couchdb.apache.org/</a> and documentation at
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/">http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/.</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-the-development-environment">
<h2>Setting Up the Development Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-the-development-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is pretty easy to setup your own development environment to work on
the Candy Basket tool. Here you will find the necessary steps to get
you started. Essentially, the following subsections can be followed in
order and everything should work.</p>
<p>The latest NodeJS will need to be installed on your operating system
(OS), binaries are available for all popular OSes. Instructions for
devleopers are given in a platform-agnostic fashion to the extent that
it is possible. However, instructions for systems administrators will
aims at being more specific in the administrator&#8217;s guide.</p>
<div class="section" id="development-tools">
<h3>Development Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#development-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You will need you typical development tools: a command line, a text
editor or IDE, a web browser with good development plugins such as the
Google Chrome Javascript console or Firefox&#8217;s web developer extension
and firebug. It does not matter much which tool; choose the ones
you&#8217;re most confortable with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nodejs-and-npm">
<span id="nodejs-npm"></span><h3>NodeJS and NPM<a class="headerlink" href="#nodejs-and-npm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>NodeJS is the Javascript platform for writing Javascript software on
the backend. The NodeJS package manager in use is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> and the canonical way to install npm
package is locally to whatever software you are developing as opposed
to globally on your operating system. Therefore, use:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ npm install express
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and not:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ npm install -g express
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are a couple of exception to this. Once you have NodeJS
installed on your machine you should install bower and grunt-cli
globally:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ npm install -b bower
$ npm install -b grunt-cli
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is all that should be needed as a foundation development setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>CouchDB<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CouchDB is used as the database for this tool. The easiest way to
install CouchDB is to use the OS&#8217; package manager (Debian&#8217;s apt-get,
Mac OS X&#8217;s brew, Red Hat&#8217;s yum). CB makes use of three databases:
<cite>candy_basket_test</cite>, <cite>candy_basket_development</cite>, <cite>candy_basket</cite> (for
production). On the development machine onle the
candy_basket_development must be created in advanced. The tests will
create and destroy the <cite>candy_basket_test</cite> database automatically, in
fact, tests will fail if this database is already present.</p>
<p>In the development database sample data can be included in a number of
ways, either programmatically importing old candies or manually
entering some sample data using the running development
application. The views will have to be created manually at the moment.</p>
<p>In the test database sample data is automatically generated as part of
unit tests and the views are also programmatically created before
used. The code in unit tests to create the views also serve as
specifications of the design views and can simply be copy pasted in
the CouchDB admin web UI.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="development-work-flow">
<h2>Development Work-flow<a class="headerlink" href="#development-work-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CB project constantly strives to improve its development
operations in order to produce software of higher quality at a more
efficient rate. This part of the developer guide will constantly
evolved and should be kept close at hand when developing on the CB
project.</p>
<div class="section" id="software-configuration-management">
<h3>Software Configuration Management<a class="headerlink" href="#software-configuration-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All software is managed through Git (Source Control Management) and
Github (Issue tracking, collaboration, etc.) in a publicly accessible
repository. Its location is currently at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ghachey/candy-basket/">https://github.com/ghachey/candy-basket/</a> but it will likely
eventually change to the owning organization Nasara. Until then you
can retrieve your own full local clone of the project with Git
installed on your machine:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git clone git@github.com:ghachey/candy-basket.git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>However, never publish work to master. The following section describes
the procedures to develop on CB.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-going-development">
<h3>On-going Development<a class="headerlink" href="#on-going-development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>New development work on a software project is either of maintenance
(fixing bugs, addressing security issues) or construction nature
(adding new features). Regardless of the type of work, all new work
should be done in a branch, not on master. For example, let&#8217;s say
we&#8217;re tackling issue #3 from the issue tracking system (Trac, Github
Issues, etc.) you should <a class="reference external" href="http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">create a branch</a>
like this <a class="reference internal" href="#pro-git" id="id2">[PRO-GIT]</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git checkout -b issue3
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Work on the issue, add relevant tests so it does not occur again, all
the while only committing locally on your branch. Discuss with team
members the fix if not sure about something. Get team members to
review and refactor code if needed. After all this is done you can go
ahead with publishing your new fix following our defined standard
procedure.</p>
<p>It is desirable to keep the history of master&#8217;s commits as clean as
possible for more effective code review. The established way of
achieving this is to squash all your local commits from your <em>issue3</em>
branch into a single properly formatted commit before publishing
changes. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits">Squashing commits</a>
in git is straight forward <a class="reference internal" href="#pro-git" id="id3">[PRO-GIT]</a>. However, the consolidated
commit must follow the following conventions adapted from <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#">Google
project AngularJS</a>
which will greatly enhanced the historical information on master and
allow for automatic generation of the changelog.</p>
<div class="section" id="squashed-commit-format">
<h4>Squashed commit format<a class="headerlink" href="#squashed-commit-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The format of the commit message must follow the following convention:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>&lt;type&gt;(&lt;scope&gt;): &lt;subject&gt;
&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any line of the commit message must not be longer 100 characters. This
allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in
various git tools.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;type&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Should be either of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>feat (when working on new feature)</li>
<li>fix (when fixing a bug or addressing a security vulnerability)</li>
<li>docs (when working on documentation)</li>
<li>style (improving formatting, missing semi colons, indentation, etc.)</li>
<li>refactor (when doing minor or major refactoring work)</li>
<li>test (when adding missing tests)</li>
<li>chore (maintain)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&lt;scope&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Should specify the location of the commit as succinctly and completely
as possible (e.g. $location, $rootScope, ngHref, ngClick, ngView)</p>
<p><strong>&lt;subject&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Subject line contains succinct description of the change. Remember it
must not be longer than 100 characters and this <em>includes</em> both the
&lt;type&gt;(&lt;scope&gt;) identified before. Here are some convensions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>use imperative, present tense: &#8220;change&#8221; not “changed” nor “changes”</li>
<li>don&#8217;t capitalize first letter</li>
<li>no period full stop (.) at the end</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong></p>
<p>[Optional] Slightly more elaborated description possibly spanning over several
lines never more than 100 characters each.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>just as in &lt;subject&gt; use imperative, present tense</li>
<li>includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong>:</p>
<p>[Optional] should include either breaking changes and/or references of
what issues were resolved if any. All breaking changes have to be
mentioned in footer with the description of the change, justification
and migration notes.</p>
<p>The following includes several examples of properly formatted squashed
commit messages.</p>
<p>A new feature commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>feat($browser): onUrlChange event (popstate/hashchange/polling)

Added new event to $browser:
* forward popstate event if available
* forward hashchange event if popstate not available
* do polling when neither popstate nor hashchange available

Breaks $browser.onHashChange, which was removed (use onUrlChange instead)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A fix for browser compatibility commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>fix($compile): couple of unit tests for IE9

Older IEs serialize html uppercased, but IE9 does not...
Would be better to expect case insensitive, unfortunately jasmine does
not allow to user regexps for throw expectations.

Closes #392
Breaks foo.bar api, foo.baz should be used instead
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A new feature request from issue #351 commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>feat(directive): ng:disabled, ng:checked, ng:multiple, ng:readonly, ng:selected

New directives for proper binding these attributes in older browsers (IE).
Added coresponding description, live examples and e2e tests.

Closes #351, #456
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Some cleanup commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>style($location): add couple of missing semi colons
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Some documentation work commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>docs(guide): updated fixed docs from Google Docs

Couple of typos fixed:
* indentation
* batchLogbatchLog -&gt; batchLog
* start periodic checking
* missing brace
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A new feature with major breaking changes:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>feat($compile): simplify isolate scope bindings

Changed the isolate scope binding options to:
* @attr - attribute binding (including interpolation)
* =model - by-directional model binding
* &amp;expr - expression execution binding

This change simplifies the terminology as well as
number of choices available to the developer. It
also supports local name aliasing from the parent.

BREAKING CHANGE: isolate scope bindings definition has changed and
the inject option for the directive controller injection was removed.

To migrate the code follow the example below:

Before:

scope: {
  myAttr: &#39;attribute&#39;,
  myBind: &#39;bind&#39;,
  myExpression: &#39;expression&#39;,
  myEval: &#39;evaluate&#39;,
  myAccessor: &#39;accessor&#39;
}

After:

scope: {
  myAttr: &#39;@&#39;,
  myBind: &#39;@&#39;,
  myExpression: &#39;&amp;&#39;,
  // myEval - usually not useful, but in cases where the
  // expression is assignable, you can use &#39;=&#39;
  myAccessor: &#39;=&#39; // in directive&#39;s template change myAccessor() to myAccessor
}

The removed `inject` wasn&#39;t generaly useful for directives so there should be no code using it.

<h2>Candy Basket Application<a class="headerlink" href="#candy-basket-application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Briefly, the Candy Basket application is composed of two main parts: a
computer consumable service on the backend (i.e. run on the server)
and a human consumable service on the frontend (i.e. runs in the
browser). The backend is a NodeJS powered RESTful service and the
frontend is an HTML, CSS and Javascript Web User Interface (UI)
capable of talking to the backend.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>README.rm &#8211; TODO - A brief introduction and pointers</li>
<li>LICENSE.md &#8211; TODO - Add license</li>
<li>CHANGELOG.md &#8211; TODO - Add automatically generated change logs</li>
<li>backend &#8211; The NodeJS RESTful service</li>
<li>frontend &#8211; The AngularJS Web application</li>
<li>docs &#8211; The documentation for this project</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="dependencies">
<h3>Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Candy Basket has a number of dependencies but they can all easily be
installed from with the root of your own clone repository. The
production backend libraries and the development and test libraries
are typically always npm packages with the dependencies clearly
defines in a <cite>packages.json</cite> file, one in the backend and one in the
frontend directory. From the backend <strong>and</strong> then from the frontend you
can simply install server side dependencies like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ npm install
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Frontend dependencies, those that will run in the client browser
powering the web UI are installed using the Bower package management
tool. From within the frontend directory you can simply do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ bower install
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Those command are idempotent and is does not matter how often you
execute them. Installing new dependencies for development can be done
with the same tool.</p>
<p>Backend dependencies and frontend development and test libraries:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ npm install new-grunt-plugin new-backend-library
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Frontend dependencies:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ bower install new-angular-third-party-directive
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Some of the packages may have additional lower level dependencies of
their own in which case you would typically have to install some
package on your OS such as xml headers from the development package.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="backend-the-restful-service">
<h3>Backend &#8211; The RESTful Service<a class="headerlink" href="#backend-the-restful-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The backend is written entirely in the Javascript programming language
implementing a simple RESTful service.</p>
<div class="section" id="high-level-architecture">
<h4>High Level Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#high-level-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Candy Basket backend is a RESTful service following a Resource
Oriented Architecture (ROA) as defined in <a class="reference internal" href="#rest-serv" id="id4">[REST-SERV]</a>. The following
tables describe its service. Note that no API version number is
included in the URI; it will be included in the host as
<a class="reference external" href="http://candy-restapi-v1.pacificpolicy.org.vu/">http://candy-restapi-v1.pacificpolicy.org.vu/</a>.</p>
<p><em>User Account Service</em></p>
<p>Each organisation can have a number of users using the tool. However,
user management is usually done using an external service such as
Active Directory or another LDAP service like OpenLDAP. However, the
users are used in the candy basket service: every source &#8220;belongs&#8221; to a
user.</p>
<p>The URI design goes like this. A &#8220;basket&#8221; refers to the whole
organisation. In other words, organisations have their private basket
of candies. An organisation (and therefore a basket) can have many
users; the organization and its users can be represented as
/basket/users/, but this will not be used at first. All candies are
associated to a user and are (at least at first) accessible to any
authenticated staff.</p>
<p>The services offer no CRUD operations on users at the moment as this
is considered to be done using an external service (Active Directory,
OpenLDAP).</p>
<p><em>Source (Candies) Service</em></p>
<p>This is the main service of candy basket: users can add &#8220;source(s)&#8221;
and tag them. A source is typically a URL but eventually could be
other things such as a document, an hyperlink or an email. In the
technical world of Candy Basket (such as in the source code) sources
are typically referred to as candies; they are exactly the same
thing. In the UI the term source is used.</p>

<div class="section" id="implementation-details">
<h4>Implementation Details<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Express and some additional express middleware libraries are glued
together to implement the RESTful service described in <a class="reference internal" href="#rest-service">rest-service</a>.</p>
<p><em>Controllers</em></p>
<p>The backend implementation is actually quite simple and most of the
work in done here, in controllers. There is a Express route defined
for each of the REST points detailed above. All those routes are
defined in <cite>backend/app/controllers.js</cite> and are implemented as
Javascript async functions. Interaction with the CouchDB persistent
store is done inside those functions.</p>
<p>Data validation is done inside a single Javascript function also in
<cite>backend/app/controllers.js</cite>. It does basic checks on all fields and
HTML sanitization before approving and sending to persist in CouchDB.</p>
<p><em>Models</em></p>
<p>The is currently no <em>models</em> as the primary data object travels in
JSON and also is persisted in JSON with no impedance mispatch between
code and data layer.  For this reason there is currently no model
layer and data is directly persisted from the controller layer.</p>
<p><em>Views</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>There is also no views and this is a backend API service only, views</dt>
<dd>are handled in the frontend.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Middleware</em></p>
<p>In Express additional functionalities is often added through
middleware, small re-usable pieces of software can gets inserted
inside a request/response cycle. Functionalities such as CORS support,
error handling, logging, headers modification, data validation and
just about everything else that enriches a web application can be done
using middleware. The rule here is the same, when it is possible to
find acceptable solutions from the community this is the preferred
approach, otherwise we need to develop our own. Community contributed
middleware is typically installed through npm and configured following
their own respective documentation. Our own custom middleware is
currently in <cite>backend/app/middlewares.js</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="experimenting-with-api">
<h4>Experimenting with API<a class="headerlink" href="#experimenting-with-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When developing it is often useful to use the RESTful API
directly. Here are some example usage.</p>
<p>Fetching all candies:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[user]$ curl -X GET http://localhost:3003/basket/candies
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Fetching a candy:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[user]$ curl -X GET http://localhost:3003/basket/candies/03c0b670e5c56bfb461a76dcf7000d1c
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Creating a candy:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>[user]$ curl -X POST \
             -H &quot;Accept: application/json&quot;  \
             -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
             -d @candy.json \
             http://localhost:3003/basket/candies
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where candy.json would be the JSON candy in a file named candy.json
accessible within the directory from which curl command is being
executed. Routes only accept JSON at the moment.  It could look
something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span>

is a lot to keep track of here: OS configuration, Web server and
modules configuration, Candy Basket application configuration, third
party libraries default security related configuration. A simple
change to the Candy Basket code base making use of the configuration
variables could open up an easy security hole. For example, in DEBUG
mode the application accepts a non existant Origin header to make
testing of backend with curl straight forward. If this were left
unchanged in production an attacker could execute cross-domain
requests simply by removing the Origin completely in its
reponses. It&#8217;s all too easy to write a single line of code that can
result in this; I wrote one myself and left it there for about 15
minutes until I realised the consequence.</p>
<p>Regular overview of all the configuration from low to high level
should be integrated into the develop, test and deploy cycle. A grep
on DEBUG on the whole Candy Basket code base might help in identifying
unsafe code. The use of scanners on the OS and Web server
(e.g. Nessus) can be useful. The important thing is the have solid and
fast development operations in place with the ability to deploy in new
secure environments that can be quality tested in quick cycles.</p>

(CSRF aka. XSRF)</a>.
A number of mechanisms exist with varying degrees of strength to
protect against CSRF. The present status quo with Candy Basket can
best be explained by summarising an email dialogue between Dan McGarry
and Ghislain Hachey:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>&gt; It is possible to protect against CSRF by checking the origin header,
&gt; but since this could be spoofed it would only be a first line of
&gt; defence. From my understanding, the highest form of security against CSRF
&gt; is making use of secret tokens first generated by the server and sent
&gt; on each request from the application (which is the number one
&gt; recommendation of OWASP. However,
&gt; according to Angular developers the above scenario is typical of
&gt; non-CORS applications where cookie-based authentication is used
&gt; (i.e. cases most vulnerable to CSRF attacks).  We have a different use
&gt; case: one, we are CORS enabled (`http://www.mnemonic.com` talking to
&gt; `http://rest.mnemonic.com`); two, we do not make use of cookie-based
&gt; authentication but make use of authentication at the Apache level
&gt; using kerberos and AD. While CORS alone is not a protection against
&gt; CRSF, the first line of defence herein (i.e. checking origin) would
&gt; make it quite hard for an attacker who would have to *both* spoof the
&gt; origin *and* trick the user into clicking a malicious page executing
&gt; it when logged into AD at work or on a VPN.
&gt;
&gt; I looked into alternatives to further secure the CSRF weakness and
&gt; found out about the use of XSRF-TOKEN. In short, the server generates
&gt; a secret token which is passed to Angular on the first request as a
&gt; cookie which is then returned by Angular on each request in a header
&gt; (i.e. X-XSRF-TOKEN). Server then verifies header matches cookie on
&gt; each request and if so considers the user legitimate (since only
&gt; Javascript running in the user browser could know the original
&gt; token). However, according to angular this is typically a non-CORS use
&gt; case and Angular does not bother returning the token I created on the
&gt; server in the request header because we do cross-domain requests
&gt; making our use case a bit more painful when it comes to using this type
&gt; of protection. See
&gt; &lt;http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http&gt; and
&gt; &lt;https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5122&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; My take on it is that we have a relatively non-typical use case:
&gt; de-coupled REST server with single page web application authenticating
&gt; with Apache/Kerberos/AD. I see two possible paths we could take:
&gt;
&gt; 1) To secure this to my taste I would make it &quot;impossible&quot; to talk to
&gt;    the REST server from anything but the frontend application
&gt;    (essentially what CORS aims except it does not offer protection
&gt;    against spoofing). At the moment, this is enforced at the web
&gt;    server level but does not protect against sophisticated
&gt;    spoofing. The angular application would make use of a user which
&gt;    would authenticate to the backend through robust use of token-based
&gt;    authentication. Token-based authentication has a number of
&gt;    advantages over the currently prevalent use of cookie-based
&gt;    authentication (good reads here
&gt;    &lt;http://www.jamesward.com/2013/05/13/securing-single-page-apps-and-rest-services&gt;,
&gt;    &lt;http://blog.auth0.com/2014/01/07/angularjs-authentication-with-cookies-vs-token/&gt;). Another
&gt;    advantage of doing this would be to take Candy Basket one step
&gt;    closer to a &quot;public offering&quot; and not just an &quot;enterprise
&gt;    offering&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Another more hackish method is to force Angular to send the
&gt;    XSRF-TOKEN by intercepting and adding headers on each XHR. However,
&gt;    the angular folks specifically deactivated this as they essentially
&gt;    say it should not be done like this and stated it was causing
&gt;    problems with the CORS pre-flights (CORS makes use of pre-flight
&gt;    OPTIONS requests to check whether non-safe requests such as POST,
&gt;    PUT and DELETE are allowed by the origin). This approach would
&gt;    secure the backend and frontend integration against spoofing but is
&gt;    not my preferred options.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In conclusion, Candy Basket&#8217;s current CSRF protection of checking the
Origin on the server side and only allowing the frontend access to the
backend seems adequate. Even if the attacker manages to spoof the
origin <em>and</em> trick the user into clicking a malicious link disguised as
cute kittens, the backend would refuse the request&#8212;even when the user
is authenticated&#8212;based on restrictions at the Apache level
(i.e. only the frontend application can talk to the backend).</p>

<h4>Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>General information can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">A9 &#8211; Using Components with Known
Vulnerabilities</a>.</p>
<p>Candy Baskets is based on a number of libraries each of which could
potentially have security vulnerabilities. While it is often
impractical to constantly assess all third party libraries it is easy
to subscribe to some kind of communication channels and observe the
evolution of all the components used in your software. Communication
channels could be either mailing lists, social networks or the github
issues tracker.</p>
<p>If there are discovered security vulnerabilities&#8212;those that are of
actual real life concern&#8212;they will often be announced through the
project&#8217;s communication channels. You should at the very least follow
announcements of the following projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Angular (and all its modules which are usually upgraded in sync)</li>
<li>D3 and D3 Cloud</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
<li>MomentJS</li>
<li>UI Bootstrap</li>
<li>UndercoreJS</li>
<li>CouchDB</li>
<li>The hosting Platform (OS, Web server, Modules...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever any of the above project announces a security vulnerability
there should be an upgrade in process. Typically, very little change
will be required, sometimes a simple matter of executing a <cite>bower
upgrade</cite> and a re-deploy. At times, you may be faced with breaking
changes which will require you to also upgrade the Candy Basket code.</p>
<p>All the above third libraries take security seriously. If you plan on
integrating a new library to add features to Candy Basket a good deal
of consideration must be given to the security aspect of the new
library. Adopting a project with little regard to security should be
<em>always</em> avoided.</p>

as described <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http">here</a>. We simple always
return an JSON object instead. For example, if we want to return an
array of Candies we would send something like {&#8220;data&#8221; : [&#8220;candy1&#8221;,
&#8220;candy2&#8221;...]} and transform the request in Angular to process the
