Candy Basket
============

A browser-based tool for improving your organisational memory. Much of
the information that organisations need to monitor their performance
is ephemeral, either tacit knowledge held in people's heads or
fragments of information from meetings, records of phone
conversations, thoughts that come to you on the bus, internet links or
bits of key reports.  Traditional knowledge management systems work
poorly for this, but Candy Basket allows you to record and tag any
information that can be stored electronically and retrieve with ease
and fast.
